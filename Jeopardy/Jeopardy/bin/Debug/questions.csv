Classes,Object Oriented,Definitions,Universal
Classes,100,What is Root Class,The top most or most generalized user class of an inheritance hierarchy.
Classes,100,What is a Sub-Class,In an inheritance hierarchy@ a sub-class is derived from an associated superclass.~~A subclass is a specialization of the generalized superclass.
Definitions,100,What is Class Hierarchies?,Hierarchies is the ordering of classes.~~Object Oriented Hierarchies are inheretance and aggregation.
Object Oriented,100,What is Overloading?,When a Sub-Class specifies an alternative definition for an attribute or method of a superclass@ it is overriding the definition in the superclass.~~Also called overloading~~Subclass uses same name if overriding a default method of the superclass.~~Sometimes doesnt need to override the method as long as it is adequeate.
Object Oriented,100,What is Reference value?,A data element whose value is an address.~~In java@ all objects are accessed by a reference.~~Any object variable is a reference to an actual object@ not the object itself.
Universal,100,What is Derived?,In an inheritance hierarchy@ a subclass is derived from a Superclass~~The derived subclass inherits the attributes and methods of the parent superclass.
Classes,200,What is Generalization?,Generalized class is known as the Super-Class (or Parent Class).
Classes,200,What is Class?,Classes are identified by a name@ and are a template or blueprint for defining attributes and operations.~~A description of a collection of objects with common attributes and behaviors.~~Specifications of a class include attributes comprising the state@ methods that carry responsibilities of the class and how to set the initial state of an object.
Definitions,200,What is a Superclass?,In an inheritance hierarchy@ a super-class is a more generalized class.~~A subclass is derived from a super-class. (Parent or base class)
Object Oriented,200,What is messages?,How objects communicate to other objects@ by the sender or caller sending messages.~~Invoking or calling a class method ~~ by having a class method called by a different object.~~ The ONLY way objects communicate.~~Used to change the state or request change to an object.
Object Oriented,200,What is a Constructor?,An operation that creates an object and defines its initial state.~~For complex objects@ construction can be a significant activity and cause the constructors of other objects to be invoked as-well.
Object Oriented,200,What is an Identity?,The characteristics or state of an object that distinguishes it from other objects.
Universal,200,What is Multiplicity?,An attribute that quantifies an association between objects.~~Specified as the range of number of objects that can participate in the association between classes.~~Usual format ''n..m'' where ''n'' is lower and ''m'' is upperlimit.~~''*'' means unlimited.
Classes,300,What is Inheritance?,A mechanism that allows one class (sub-class) to share attributes and behaviors of another class.~~Defines a ''is-a'' relationship~~Subclass inherits attributes and behaviors of the super-class and usually extends or modifies those attributes.
Classes,300,What is Multiple-inheritance?,When a sub-class is derived from multiple superclasses@ it is said to have multiple inheritance.
Classes,300,What is Method?,An operation or Service performed upon an object@ defined as 'Part Of' the declaration of a class.~~Used to implement object or behavior.~~Synonyms: Function@ Operation@ Service.
Definitions,300,What is Generalization & Specialization?,Known as a ''Type-Of'' or ''Is-A'' relationship.~~Common features between classes go in the super class@ and the features that make the different (specialization) go in the sub-classes.~~No cardinality with Generalization or Specialization.
Object Oriented,300,What is ''Part-of'',The opposite of ''has-a''~~The component is a ''part-of'' the whole.
Object Oriented,300,What is an Attribute?,Characteristics that describe an object.~~A property or trait that is associated with an Object.~~Ex: Attribute defines height@ weight@ and name of Human
Universal,300,What is Cardinality?,When relating 2 objects@ refers to the number of expected instances of each class. ~~Many to One~~One to Many~~Many to Many~~One to One
Classes,400,What is Specialization?,The specialized class is known as a sub-class (or child class)~~Sub-class inherits characteristics from a Super-Class (Parent) and expands them.
Classes,400,What is Dynamic Link Library?,Resolved at run-time & can be changed without recompiling the program.~~During execution (runtime) the program links the library file (.dll)~~It's more preferred than .sll@ easier to upgrade@ must be located in centralized locations@ bugs can cripple all programs that use it.
Definitions,400,What is ''Aggregation''?,A whole/part hierarchy~~Aggregate objects include (''has-a'') other objects@ each of which is considered to be a part of (part-of) the aggregate object.~~A relationship between classes where one class will be made up / contain objects of another class.~~One class acts as the container and the other as the contents. 
Definitions,400,What is UML? (Also Define),Unified Modeling Language~~A graphical depiction of the software structure.~~It's a tool used along the software engineering process.
Object Oriented,400,What is Dynamic Binding?,User when the compiler is not able to resolve the class / binding at compile time (Delayed until runtime)~~Overriding is an example of Dynamic Binding.~~Dynamic Binding allows polymorphism to work.
Object Oriented,400,What is ''Has-a'',A way to state a whole/part relationship~~The whole object ''has-a'' part.
Object Oriented,400,What is Object Lifetime?,An objects lifetime is the time an object exists - from its instantiation in its constructor until the object goes out of scope.~~Objects are initialized when needed@ and eventually are disposed.~~While alive@ they maintain their own identity and state~~
Object Oriented,400,What is Garbage Collection,The automatic detection and freeing of memory that is no longer in use.~~An object becomes available for Garbage Collection when it is no longer referred to by any other object.
Object Oriented,400,What is Operation?,Something an object does~~A process performed by the object~~Referred to as Behaviors. Ex: Operation for a human is to Walk@ Eat@ and Sleep.
Object Oriented,400,What is Behavior,Activity of an object that is visible to the outside world or something an object does.~~How an object responds to messages by changing its internal state or returning state information to other objects.~~Sometimes referred to as Operations.
Object Oriented,400,What is State?,Reflects the current values of all the attributes of a given object.~~Is the result of the behavior of an object over time.
Universal,400,What is ''Is-a'' test?,A simple test to check for proper inheritance design.~~Ex: If you cannot say Sub-Class ''is-a'' kind of the super-class@ then inheritance is probably not appropriate.
Universal,400,What is Composition?,A form of aggregation where the whole cannot ecist without having the parts.
Universal,400,What is Whole / Part Hierarchy?,To include one class as part of another.~~Characterized by a ''has-a'' relationship.~~A relationship between classes where one class is made up of or contains objects of another class.~~Most O-O havent defined special language support for Whole / Parts~~ critical for O-O Programmers.
Universal,400,What is Library Model Maintenance?,.NET has over 7000 classes and types and allows multiple languages the ability to use the same libraries.~~Centralizes any code all languages use.~~Encapsulation and abstraction are accomplished by libraries.~~Allows no program to be written from scratch.
Classes,500,What is Default Behaviors?,In an inheritance hierarchy@ the class behaviors defined by the superclass will be used by default unless overriden by a subclass.
Definitions,500,What is Instantiation?,Creating an instance of an object of a given class~~Instantiating an instance brings it into existance.
Object Oriented,500,What is ''is-a'',A term used in inheritance hierarchies~~A sub-class ''is-a'' specialized kind of more general super-class
Object Oriented,500,What is Polymorphism?,A characteristic of inheritance that ensures that instances of such subclasses behave correctly.~~The final fundamental characteristic of object-oriented systems.~~Polymorphism properties allows instances of objects to behave correctly@ automatically@ and seamlessly.
Object Oriented,500,What is Object State & Behavior,While an Object exists@ it has a state and behavior.~~State is expressed by its attributes.~~Behavior is expressed by the methods associated with the object.~~State usually reflects changeable attributes of an object~~Each object has its own Identity@ and requires use of its identity when used.
Universal,500,What is Single Inheritance?,When a subclass is derived from a single superclass@ it is said to have single inheritance.
Universal,500,What is Association?,Relationship between two or more classes.~~Indicates how objects of the different classes relate to eachother.~~Most common & simple relationship between objects in O-O programming.
Universal,500,What are Two ways to implement whole / part?,What is Aggregation & Comparison~~Aggregation:(has-a & part-of)~~Composition: Whole can't exist with out parts.
Universal,500,What is the purpose of .NET?,1. Allows multiple languages to use the same libraries.~~2. Allow code written on one computer@ regardless of OS@ to run on another that has .NET Libraries installed.
Universal,500,What is Object Oriented Design Phase? (OOD),The process of planning a system of interacting objects for the purpose of solving a software problem.~~One approach to software design.~~The process of defining the Solution based on each problem identified in the (OOA) Phase.~~Defining the Components@ interfaces@ objects@ classes@ attributes and Operations satisfying requirements.
Universal,500,What are 2 Steps to Problem Specification (OOA),1. Te developer creates a system function statement that describes the requirements of the system.~~2. The developer creates use-cases that describe possible scenarios that might be encountered by the system.~~ Use-cases should represent normal & abnormal situations.
Universal,500,What is the Object Oriented Analysis Phase (OOA),
