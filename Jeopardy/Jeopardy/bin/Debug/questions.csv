Classes,Object Oriented,Definitions,Universal
Classes,200,What is Encapsulation?,The process of packaging data together with its corresponding operations.~~One of the most important aspects of OO Programming; it allows each object to be independent.~~Implementation of attributes and objects are hidden through encapsulation.~~Classes are the main programming tool to use encapsulation.
Classes,300,What is ''Part-of'',The opposite of ''has-a''~~The component is a ''part-of'' the whole.
Classes,400,What is Abstraction?,A mechanism that represents a complex@ real-world situation with a simplified model.~~Basic tool of all programming.~~Serves as a way to model a real world problem.~~Abstraction is modeling the real world in terms that can be implemented in a computer program.
Classes,400,What is Dynamic Link Library?,Resolved at run-time & can be changed without recompiling the program.~~During execution (runtime) the program links the library file (.dll)~~It's more preferred than .sll@ easier to upgrade@ must be located in centralized locations@ bugs can cripple all programs that use it.
Classes,400,What is Dynamic Binding?,User when the compiler is not able to resolve the class / binding at compile time (Delayed until runtime)~~Overriding is an example of Dynamic Binding.~~Dynamic Binding allows polymorphism to work.
Classes,500,What is Abstraction with Objects?,Abstraction and OO fit well together.~~Object oriented abstracts the real world based on objects and their interactions with other objects.~~You can define objects with all the attributes and responsibilities needed to implement the model.
Definitions,200,What is Behavior,Activity of an object that is visible to the outside world or something an object does.~~How an object responds to messages by changing its internal state or returning state information to other objects.~~Sometimes referred to as Operations.
Definitions,300,What is Static Link Library?,Included in project at compile time.~~Cannot be modified without recompiling a program that uses it.~~Will contain a copy within the program source code.~~.LIB file extension~-Harder to upgrade~-Bigger source code~utilizes more diskspace~easier to deploy@ all resources contained within.
Definitions,400,What is ''Aggregation''?,A whole/part hierarchy~~A relationship between classes where one class will be made up / contain objects of another class.~~One class acts as the container and the other as the contents. ~~Includes (''has-a'') other objects@ each of which is considered to be a part of (part-of) the aggregate object.
Definitions,500,What is Principle of Libraries,Provide a central location for class maintenance and reduce the need to include redundant code in multiple code for multiple projects with multiple maintenance points.~~Use pre compiled code for accomplishing tasks.
Definitions,400,What is .NET Library Module Maintenance?,Has over 7000 classes and types and allows multiple languages the ability to use the same libraries.~~Can be installed on any computer that supports the .NET Framework~~Centralizes any code all languages use.~~Encapsulation and abstraction are accomplished by libraries.~~Allows no program to be written from scratch.
Definitions,400,What is Operation?,Something an object does~~A process performed by the object~~Referred to as Behaviors. Ex: Operation for a human is to Walk@ Eat@ and Sleep.
Object Oriented,200,What is an Identity?,The characteristics or state of an object that distinguishes it from other objects.
Object Oriented,300,What is an Attribute?,Characteristics that describe an object.~~A property or trait that is associated with an Object.~~Ex: Attribute defines height@ weight@ and name of Human
Object Oriented,300,What is Interface Documentations?,Document that shows and describes the look and feel of the end product user interface.~~Not mandatory~~Helps visualize end product.
Object Oriented,200,What is ''Has-a'',A way to state a whole/part relationship~~The whole object ''has-a'' part.
Object Oriented,200,What is Object Oriented Programming?,Where the design is implemented and coding begins~~Take all documents@ artifacts@ and specifications from the previous 2 phases to use.~~''Where the rubber meets the road''.
Object Oriented,400,System sequence diagram,A picture that shows events that external actors generate@ their order and possible inter-system events.~~For a particular scenario of a use-case.
Object Oriented,300,What is Object Oriented Software Engineering?,Uses the classes of objects to design the software system.~~Provides an accurate representation of reality.~~Leads to reusable code;~-Helping to reinforce the principles of modularity and modifiability.~~Objects are more reliable & live longer due to modifiability w/o affecting the rest of the system.
Object Oriented,400,Object Oriented Analysis Phase,Process of defining the problem in terms of objects.~~The examination of a problem bymodeling it as a group of interacting objects.~~An object is defined by its class@ data elements@ and behavior.
Object Oriented,100,What is ''is-a'',A term used in inheritance hierarchies~~A sub-class ''is-a'' specialized kind of more general super-class
Object Oriented,100,What is Object State & Behavior,While an Object exists@ it has a state and behavior.~~State is expressed by its attributes.~~Behavior is expressed by the methods associated with the object.~~State usually reflects changeable attributes of an object~~Each object has its own Identity@ and requires use of its identity when used.
Object Oriented,500,What is Relational Data Model,An abstract model that describes how data is represented and used.~~If an object database is not used@ the relational data model should usually be created before the design@ since the strategy chosen for object relational mapping is an output of the OOD process.~~It is possible to develop relational data model & OOD artifacts in parallel.
Object Oriented,500,What is the Three phases of object oriented lifecycle?,1. Object Oriented Analysis.~2. Object oriented Design.~3. Object oriented programming~~- Must be done in this order. (Product of each becomes input of next)
Universal,200,What is Conceptual Model,The result of OOA Phase.~~Captures concepts in the Problem Domain.~~Explicitly chosen to be independent of implementation details@ such as concurrency or data storage.
Universal,200,What is 5 Object-Oriented Design Inputs,Conceptual model~~Use cases~~System sequence diagram~~User interface documentations (If applicable)~~Relational data model (If applicable).
Universal,200,What is Composition?,A form of aggregation where the whole cannot ecist without having the parts.
Universal,300,What is Use Cases?,List of sequence of events that do something useful.~~Each use-case provides one or more scenarios that convey how the system should interact with the users called ''actors'' to achieve a specific business goal or function.
Universal,300,What is the purpose of .NET?,1. Allows multiple languages to use the same libraries.~~2. Allow code written on one computer@ regardless of OS@ to run on another that has .NET Libraries installed.
Universal,100,What is Whole / Part Hierarchy?,To include one class as part of another.~~Characterized by a ''has-a'' relationship.~~A relationship between classes where one class is made up of or contains objects of another class.~~Most O-O haven't defined special language support for Whole / Parts~~ critical for O-O Programmers.
Universal,500,What are Two ways to implement whole / part?,What is Aggregation & Composition~~Aggregation:(has-a & part-of)~~Composition: Whole can't exist with out parts.
Universal,500,What is Object Oriented Design Phase? (OOD),The process of planning a system of interacting objects for the purpose of solving a software problem.~~One approach to software design.~~The process of defining the Solution based on each problem identified in the (OOA) Phase.~~Defining the Components@ interfaces@ objects@ classes@ attributes and Operations satisfying requirements.
Universal,500,What are 2 Steps to Problem Specification (OOA),1. The developer creates a system function statement that describes the requirements of the system.~~2. The developer creates use-cases that describe possible scenarios that might be encountered by the system.~~ Use-cases should represent normal & abnormal situations.
Classes,100,What is Root Class,The top most or most generalized user class of an inheritance hierarchy.
Classes,500,What is Default Behaviors?,In an inheritance hierarchy@ the class behaviors defined by the superclass will be used by default unless overridden by a subclass.
Definitions,100,What is Class Hierarchies?,Hierarchies is the ordering of classes.~~Object Oriented Hierarchies are inheritance and aggregation.
Definitions,100,What is 2 Types of Libraries?,1. Static Link Libraries (SLL or .lib)~~2. Dynamic Link Libraries (.DLL)
Definitions,200,What is UML? (Also Define),Unified Modeling Language~~A graphical depiction of the software structure.~~It's a tool used along the software engineering process.
Universal,400,What is ''Is-a'' test?,A simple test to check for proper inheritance design.~~Ex: If you cannot say Sub-Class ''is-a'' kind of the super-class@ then inheritance is probably not appropriate.
Classes,300,What is the Two Types of Inheritance,1. Association between objects~~2. Aggregation between objects.
